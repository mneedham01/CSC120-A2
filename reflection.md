What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The hardest part of this assignment was the leap to using object-oriented programming. Figuring out how the classes would interact, and what would go in the class section versus the testing/main section was difficult. Additionally, figuring out the syntax was hard, but we copied the syntax from the OneCard class example and sought help. Figuring out which method would go in each class was more intuitive than we expected. The advice we would give would be to go to office hours early on.
